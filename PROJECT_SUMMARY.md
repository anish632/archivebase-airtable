# ArchiveBase - Project Summary

## 🎯 What Was Built

A fully functional Airtable extension (MVP) that solves the critical problem of record limits and performance degradation in large Airtable bases.

### Core Features Implemented

✅ **Dashboard**
- Real-time record counts across entire base
- Archive statistics and history
- Usage tracking for free tier (500 records/month)
- Storage savings visualization

✅ **Archive Rules Engine**
- Age-based rules (archive records older than X days)
- Status-based rules (archive by field value)
- Enable/disable rules on the fly
- Visual rule cards with descriptions

✅ **Archive Executor**
- Scan records matching rules before archiving
- Preview matching record count
- CSV export of archived data
- Batch deletion (50 records at a time, Airtable API limit)
- Progress tracking during archive process
- Automatic file naming with timestamps

✅ **Pricing Display**
- Three-tier pricing structure (Free, Pro, Team)
- Feature comparison
- Usage indicators for free tier
- Upgrade CTAs (structure ready for Lemon Squeezy)

### Tech Implementation

**Frontend (Airtable Extension)**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Airtable Blocks SDK for UI components
- GlobalConfig for data persistence
- Real-time base queries

**Code Quality**
- Component-based architecture
- Separation of concerns (components, utils, types)
- Error handling and user feedback
- Type-safe interfaces

**Backend Structure (Ready for Phase 2)**
- Next.js API routes scaffolded
- Archive storage endpoint stub
- Billing integration structure
- Webhook handlers planned

## 🎨 User Interface

### Navigation
- Tab-based interface (Dashboard, Archive Rules, Archive Now, Pricing)
- Clean header with branding
- Responsive layout

### Key Screens

**Dashboard**
- 4 stat cards (Total Records, Archived, Storage Saved, Last Archive)
- Usage bar for free tier
- Upgrade prompts

**Archive Rules**
- Empty state with call-to-action
- Rule cards with enable/disable toggles
- Add rule form with field selectors
- Delete confirmation

**Archive Now**
- Table selector
- Rule selector
- Scan button with loading state
- Results preview with record count
- Archive & Delete confirmation
- Progress bar during execution

**Pricing**
- 3-column layout
- Feature lists with checkmarks
- Current plan indicator
- Upgrade buttons (mock for now)

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### CSV Export Engine
- Handles all Airtable field types:
  - Attachments → URLs
  - Multi-selects → Semicolon-separated
  - Collaborators → Names/emails
  - Linked records → IDs
  - Dates, checkboxes, formulas
- Proper CSV escaping (quotes, commas, newlines)
- Automatic download with timestamped filename

### Record Filtering
- Age-based: Date comparisons with configurable thresholds
- Status-based: Field value matching (single select, text)
- Extensible for custom formulas (Phase 2)
- Error handling for missing/invalid fields

### Data Persistence
- Archive rules stored in Airtable GlobalConfig
- Archive stats tracked across sessions
- Survives extension reloads

### Batch Processing
- Respects Airtable API limits (50 records/batch)
- Progress tracking
- Error recovery

## 📊 Market Positioning

**Problem**: Airtable bases slow down significantly as record counts grow beyond 50-100K, a frequent complaint in the Airtable community

**Current Solutions**: 
- Manual base duplication (tedious, error-prone)
- Delete without backup (risky)
- Upgrade to enterprise (expensive)

**ArchiveBase Solution**:
- Automated archiving with rules
- Safe CSV backups
- Metadata retention for searchability
- One-click restore (roadmap)
- Cost-effective vs. upgrading Airtable

**Pricing Strategy**:
- Free tier: Hook users, validate use case
- Pro ($29/mo): Sweet spot for power users
- Team ($79/mo): Enterprise features, compliance
